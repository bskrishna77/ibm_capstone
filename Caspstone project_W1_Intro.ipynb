    "This project can be extended to explore the USA as well. By this project the bank can decide on ATM removal or shifting to other places where it can be used effectively. By leveraging the ATM transaction data the bank can better optimize cash replenishment in the ATMs. This project will also be useful for Wells Fargo in reducing cost by deciding on which ATM to visit first and which one to go next rather than visiting every ATM whenever it runs out of cash."
